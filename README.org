** Features
   It only supports cli input and depends on webcam input , it does not support custom images till now.

   
** Performance
   It has quite low accuracy and is not a serious tool.Recommendations to improve it are welcome!

   
** Dependencies
   It requires [[keras][https://keras.io]] for DeepLearning and [[OpenCV][https://opencv.org]] for taking images from the webcam.
